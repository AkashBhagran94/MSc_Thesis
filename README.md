 - The project notebook contains small graph experiments and a plot for a 50 vertex graph.
 - calc_z_ext_with_multi_processing.py is designed for larger experiments and just uses the simulated annealing algorithm across multiple logical processors
 - functions.py contains all functions orignally seen in the project notebook too, but slightly tailored for the multiprocessing file.
